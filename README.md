# David Buckingham -Data Portfolio
## About
Hello, I'm David.  I have had a unique journey into the world of data, getting my BS in Kinsiology/Exercise science, working in Parks and Rec, and then aviation logistics, discovering a passion for using data to uncover meaningful insights along the way.  Combining my strong foundation in life sciences, leadership and social skills learned working in Parks and Recreation, and the technical and analytical skills learned from aviation logistics, I am excited to bring a unique perspective to the world of data.

This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science related topics.

## Portfolio Projects
In this section I will showcase projects I have done, briefly describing the technology stack used in each.
### Exploring Correlations in Movie Data
**Code:** [Exploring Correlations in Movie Data](https://github.com/davidbuckingham2/Python-movie-data-analysis/blob/main/Analyzing%20movie%20data%20in%20python.ipynb)

**Goal:** Determine which factors contribute to the success of a movie

**Description:** In this project I analyzed a dataset of movies released between 1980 and 2022.  The dataset included fields such as genre, release date, budgets, gross earnings etc.  This project involved loading the data, cleaning and preprocessing it, and analyzing the correlation between various fields.

**Skills:** Data cleaning, data analysis, correlation matrices, hypothesis testing, data visualization.

**Technology**: Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib.

**Conclusion:** The factors contributing to the success of a movie are votes and budget as they have the highest correlation. It was also determined that, despite my own hypothesis, the Company, Movie name, and Genre had no significant correlation to a movies success.
