# David Buckingham - Data Portfolio
## About <a name="about"></a>
Hello, I'm David, and I have had a unique journey into the world of data. Starting my BS in Kinsiology/Exercise science I went on to work in Parks and Rec, took some time off to fly and earn my private pilots license, before moving into aviation logistics.  Along this journey, i discovered a passion for using data to uncover meaningful insights.  Combining my strong foundation in life sciences, leadership and social skills learned working in Parks and Recreation, critical thinking and problem solving needed to fly, and the technical and analytical skills learned from aviation logistics, I am excited to bring a unique perspective to the world of data.

This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science related topics.

## Portfolio Projects <a name="portfolio-projects"></a>
In this section I will showcase projects I have done, briefly describing the technology stack used in each.

## Python
### Exploring Correlations in Movie Data <a name="python-movie-analysis"></a>
**Code:** [Exploring Correlations in Movie Data using Python](https://github.com/davidbuckingham2/Python-movie-data-analysis/tree/main)

**Goal:** Determine which factors contribute to the success of a movie

**Description:** In this project I analyzed a dataset of movies released between 1980 and 2022.  The dataset included fields such as genre, release date, budgets, gross earnings etc.  This project involved loading the data, cleaning and preprocessing it, and analyzing the correlation between various fields.

**Skills:** Data cleaning, data analysis, correlation matrices, hypothesis testing, data visualization.

**Technology**: Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib.

**Conclusion:** The factors contributing to the success of a movie are votes and budget as they have the highest correlation. It was also determined that, despite my own hypothesis, the Company, Movie name, and Genre had no significant correlation to a movies success.

### Cleaning NAICS Data with Python <a name="NAICS-data-cleaning"></a>
**Code:** [Cleaning NAICS Data with Python](https://github.com/davidbuckingham2/Python-Data-Cleaning-with-Table-of-Size-Standards/blob/main/'Table%20of%20Size%20Standards'%20Data%20Cleaning.ipynb)

**Description:** This project focuses on cleaning and preparing a dataset containing information about NAICS (North American Industry Classification System) codes, industry descriptions, and size standards for businesses. The goal of this project is to demonstrate essential data cleaning skills.

**Skills:** ETL, Data Cleaning, String Manipulation, Data Appending, Data Exploration

**Technology:** Pandas, Numpy

### Exploring Public Loan Data with Python <a name="Exploring-Public-Loan-Data-with-Python"></a>
 **Code**: [Exploring Public Loan Data with Python](https://github.com/davidbuckingham2/Exploring-Public-Loan-Data-with-Python/blob/main/Exploring%20Public%20Loan%20Data%20with%20Python.ipynb)
 
 **Description**: This is a data exploration project that focuses on analyzing a dataset related to Small Business Administration (SBA) loans. The project uses Python and various data analysis libraries to perform data cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis on the dataset.
  
 **Skills Used**: Data Cleaning and Preprocessing, Data Visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn, Univariate and Bivariate Analysis, Descriptive Statistics
  
**Technology:** Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## SQL
### Nashville Housing Data Cleaning <a name="nashville-housing-data-cleaning"></a>
**Code:** [Nashville Housing Data Cleaning in SQL](https://github.com/davidbuckingham2/Cleaning-Nashville-Housing-data)

**Description:** The dataset contains a list of houses that have been sold in Nashville between 2013 and 2019. This project includes several data cleaning tasks such as standardizing date formats, populating missing data, removing duplicates, and more.

**Skills:** DML(Data Manipulation Language), DQL (Data Query Language), DDL (Data Definition Language).

**Technology:** SQL Server

### Covid 19 Data Exploration <a name="covid-data-exploration"></a>
**Code:** [Exploring COVID data in SQL](https://github.com/davidbuckingham2/Covid-Data-Exploration/blob/main/SQL_covid_exploration.sql)

**Description:** The dataset contains records of Covid-19 cases, deaths and vaccine records by country from 2020-2023. This project includes the following steps: data loading, data cleaning and preprocessing and EDA (exploratory data analysis).

**Skills:** Joins, CTE's, Temp Tables, Windows Functions, Aggregate Functions, Creating Views, Converting Data Types

**Technology:** SQL Server

### Video Game Data Analysis <a name="video-game-analysis"></a>

**Code:** [Video Games Data Analysis](https://github.com/davidbuckingham2/SQL-Video-Game-Analysis/tree/main)

**Description:** In this project I analyzed a dataset found on Kaggle containing data on video games released from 1977-2020.  By comparing the tables on game sales with with critc and user reviews, I was able to gather various insights on the video game market throughout the years.

**Skills:** Joins, Set operations, Subqueries, Aggregate functions, EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)

**Technology:** SQL Server

### LEGO Data Analysis <a name="lego-data-analysis"></a>
**Code:** [LEGO Data Analysis](https://github.com/davidbuckingham2/Lego-Data-SQL-Analysis)

**Goal:** Explore insights and trends within a LEGO dataset.

**Description:** This project involved the analysis of a comprehensive LEGO dataset, encompassing LEGO sets, themes, and parts. SQL was used to extract, transform, and analyze the data. The primary focus was on understanding patterns related to LEGO set sizes, themes, release years, and seasonal trends.

**Skills:** SQL data extraction, data transformation, JOINs, aggregation, subqueries, common table expressions (CTEs),
